# Patch Camelyon - machine learning project
This project is on the patch camelyon dataset which is a challenging image classification dataset. It consists of 327.680 color images (96 x 96px) extracted from histopathologic scans of lymph node sections. Each image is annoted with a binary label indicating presence of metastatic tissue. 

## Parts involved
The notebook can be separated into following parts
1. Classifying the images with shallow learning methods (using support vector machines, random forests and boosting)
2. CNN base model
3. Optimizing on the CNN model.
